//Here description of the "VendingMachine" JAVA file
This is a Java program that simulates a vending machine that can dispense either coffee or tea. 
The program includes a VendingMachine class that defines the basic functions of the vending machine,
a Coffee class that extends VendingMachine and includes additional functions for coffee, 
and a Tea class that extends VendingMachine and includes additional functions for tea.

//Here description of the "Main" JAVA file
The main method uses a while loop to allow the user to select a drink and add sugar and milk. 
The user is prompted to select either coffee or tea, and then prompted to select the type of drink. 
The corresponding method for the selected drink is then called, and the program ends.
The classes include methods for adding milk and sugar, as well as getting the price and the amount of milk and sugar.



• How flexible is your implementation, e.g., how you add or remove in future new drink types?
For the flexibility it could be extended of creating the new classes.

• How is the simplicity and understandability of your implementation?
For the simplicity I created less classes ass possible, that helps better understand the code. 
I commented code ass well to avoid confusing moments.


• How you avoided duplicated code?
To avoid duplicated code I have used functions as much as possible, which is also 
helps maintain code and make it more modular.
